	<strong class="bioText">Vaux Street is a place in Northwest Philadelphia. <i>Vaux Taux</i> is a feeling. It is a trio featuring the brilliant Matt Scarano on Drums, the athletic Ben Karp on guitar, and bassist + lead composer/arranger Chris Coyle. These three create music that meshes jazz sensibility with modern sounds that are at times groove-oriented, explorative and mathematic. Vaux Street is where Coyle and Scarano began a musical journey in 2006, and where Scarano still lives and hosts many a “talk”.</strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong class="bioText">Each an accomplished performer in their own right, Coyle, Karp and Scarano have performed with the likes of Chris Brubeck, Ben Schacter, John Swana, The Relache Ensemble, and Time for Three. They’ve toured all over the US as well as internationally, at venues such as Carnegie Hall, The Kimmel Center, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Royal Albert Hall (London) and many more. They have also been recognized with awards from American Composers Forum, the McKnight Foundation, and the Pennsylvania Council for the Arts.</strong>
